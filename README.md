# Assignment-1-MSB1015
Welcome to the repository for Assignment 1, where newly acquired programming skills have been used to answer the question
"What are the top 25 mouse genes encoding for the most proteins?".

Version 2.0 for release 18th September 2019: Task code.htm visualises the query result as a bubble graph.

Version 1.0 pre-release:  Task code.htm displayed the query result as an html table.

This repository is a record of just about all the steps it took me to get to the point where I could use html, Javascript, and SPARQL 
to successfully query the WikiData database and visualise the query results. So, other contents include:
  the annotated templates provided by the Course Supervisor which were used to build Task code;
  and index.htm a collection of notes and links that were useful to me during work on the code.
  
This Assignment is part of the course
Scientific Programming (codename MSB1015) on 
the Master's Systems Biology at Maastricht University, Netherlands.
