# Assignment-1-MSB1015
Welcome to the repository for Assignment 1, where newly acquired programming skills will be used to answer the question
"What are the 14 mouse genes encoding for the most proteins?".

The Assignment is part of the course
Scientific Programming (codename MSB1015) on 
the Master's Systems Biology at Maastricht University, Netherlands.

By the time it is finished, this repository will be a record of
just about all the steps it took me to get to the point where I could use html, Javascript, SQL and other languages 
to successfully query the WikiData database and visualise the query results.

We are currently (15 September 2019) only in the project's first week, 
so only a basic html, js and SPRQL framework is in place for the Task code.

Update 17 September: picked taxon Mus musculus to replace E.coli in the original question. 
Mus musculus is a good replacement as it is a model organism and Wikidata has enough data to make an interesting query.
Query prepared and functioning in Task code.
Result table embedded in index.htm for Wednesday 18th September Skills Training visualisation session.
Understanding that WikiData is a work in progress and by no means a complete record.
The taxon Enterobacteriaceae (Q380136) is connected to only a single gene by the relationship 
"Found in taxon" (P703). Anthrax, chlamydia and other model species have several hundred each.
The bacterial strain Helicobacter pylori 26695 (Q21065231) has 1421 genes associated in WikiData.

Searching WikiData for contains "coli" gives up many well-documented E Coli strains, eg. (Q24533466), 
which could be linked into the Enterobacteriaceae (Q380136) taxon. 
But I am aware that, while each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, 
the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000.

Submission deadline is 23 September 2019.
