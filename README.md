# Assignment-1-MSB1015
Welcome to the repository for Assignment 1.

The Assignment is part of the course
Scientific Programming (codename MSB1015) on 
the Master's Systems Biology at Maastricht University, Netherlands.

By the time it is finished, this repository will be a record of
just about all the steps it took me to get to the point where I could use html, Javascript, SQL and other languages 
to successfully query the WikiData database and visualise the query results.

We are currently (15 September 2019) only in the project's first week, 
so only a basic html, js and SPRQL framework is in place for the Task code.

Submission deadline is 23 September 2019.
